    "This notebook contains the scripts needed for the extraction of images from the persistent landing zone, its processing and storage to the formatted zone. The formatted zone is represented by another bucket and aims to replicate the same folder structure as the persistent landing zone. The difference is that the data format in the formatted zone has been homogenized, as one of the steps of our data pipeline. \n",

    "1. Extraction of images from persistent landing zone.\n",
    "2. Homogenization of data. In this case, that will consist on ensuring that all images are converted to .png files.\n",
