    "# Obtaining the data from datasources\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on the design and execution of a data processing pipeline that transforms raw data from multiple sources into a structued format suitable for machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a real scenario, such data sources would come from different repositories or systems, for example, different databases or APIs, each containing only a subset of the required information. However, these idealized and openly accessible data sources do not always exist in practice, especially when the project involves combining multiple types of information. To overcome this limitation and for academic purposes, we have created our own data sources by extracting, restructuring, and combining data from existing public datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook therefore begins by introducing the different simulated data sources we created, explaining their purpose and structure. After that, in the [temporal landing zone](./temporal_zone.ipynb) we demonstrate how the pipeline ingests theses sources, and futher applies transformations to produce a final dataset ready for use in ML models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different datasources we used or created are the following:\n",
    "1. [huggingface dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Moaaz55/skin_cancer_questions_answers). This dataset is used for ...\n",
    "2. Self made audio dataset. This dataset is used for ...\n",
    "3. Wikipedia web scrapping information. This dataset is used for...\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sections, we will discuss how the data is obtained to further insert them into the first zone of the pipeline."

This process involved extracting the full text from these pages. We achieved this by obtaining the HTML and then, we saw that the data is contained in all the <p> HTML tags. Therefore, we iterated each of this components and we extracted all the rellevant information and saved into a file to introduce the dataset into the pipeline in the next process. The result is a cusotm-made text dataset centered on skin cancer information, designed for different type of data science applications."
